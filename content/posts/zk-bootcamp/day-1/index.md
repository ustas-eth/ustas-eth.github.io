### The introduction
There were several speakers from Encode, zkSync, and Extropy. The interesting parts for me were:
1. A structured overview of the problems that crypto and blockchain solve:
- inflation
- availability of money
- crises
- centralization
- etc.
2. Detailed insights into the history of consensus mechanisms and the development of the Merge. 
We also quickly covered cryptographic basics such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol and Merkle trees.
