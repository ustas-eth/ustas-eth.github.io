### Rust
In the first part of the lesson, we've covered some common topics like Cargo, enums, `match`, `Option`, etc., in Rust synaxis, which you can find in any popular guide.

Rust is a very popular language in the ZKP space, because of its core features:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Concurrency without data races
- Abstraction without overhead

Check these two books to learn Rust:

Many projects like StarkNet and Aztec use Rust-like languages to program smart contracts (circuits).

### Understanding and Analyzing Layer 2
How we differentiate L2s (from https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/):
- Generalized like Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet, which are EVM-complete, and you can run the same things as on Ethereum.
- Application specific like dYdX, Immutable, and Loopring that have some limitations in the possible instructions.

Back in 2020, we ran monolithic rollups but later realized they could be separated into several layers:

- We usually use Ethereum to store data for DA because it has established security, but we're not limited in this regard. We can use a different storage, but it'll have other security assumptions.
- The Sequencing layer defines the collection of user transactions and their publication to the DA layer.
- The Derivation layer works very close to the DA layer and processes data to define the inputs for the Execution layer.
- The Execution layer takes inputs from the Derivation layer and processes outputs by some rules (for example, EVM opcodes).
- The Settlement layer is read-only and used by external parties to retrieve some data from the L2 blockchain. Usually, we have a Sequencer that collects the transactions by some API.

Vitalik Buterin introduced rollup milestones in this post: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571

- Stage 0: full training wheels
- Stage 1: limited training wheels
- Stage 2: no training wheels

Where 0 is the most centralized and unsecure stage, and 2 is the most decentralized and secure.

Also, check out a post by L2Beat: https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe

Currently, there are only two rollups on Stage 2 (Fuel and DeGate), and the most popular ones are still on Stage 0.
