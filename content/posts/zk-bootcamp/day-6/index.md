### Agnostic Layer 2 Transaction Lifecycle
More Rust things like traits, generics, vectors, iterators, and shadowing.

On the previous day, we concentrated on OP Stack, but it is only fair to mention ZK Stack by zkSync and Madara by StarkNet:

Generally speaking, L2s follow a similar design.

As you can see, Users send their transactions to the Sequencer, which executes these, batch, compresses, and submits to L1. The final component is an L1 smart contract that verifies the outputs of the Sequencer.
