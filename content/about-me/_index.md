#### Hello, it's /ʲustɑs/

Quick bio:
21 years old. Originally from Lviv, Ukraine. I speak English, Ukrainian, Russian, a little Portuguese and Spanish.

I'm pro-FOSS, privacy, and love to share things that I've learned.

Some highlights of my experience:

- Smart contracts security, 2 years. I'm an active participant on Code4rena. I've found about 5 high and 15 medium issues in 10 public contests. Including 1 issue in the zkSync 1.1M contest which earned me 12k USD.

- Web2 security. A while before my first web3 job, I studied web and browser security from various black hat forums to get insights into how they think, what they usually do, and how things work behind the scenes: carding, bruteforce, reverse engineering (I deobfuscated different JS scripts and Android apps).

- Educational writing. I have a couple of article series on Github, where I share my knowledge about ZK, Ethereum, and security research.

- Solidity development. I created several smart contract systems, among them the Light Towers game (live on Polygon).

- In crypto since early 2017 (7 years). I started with small activities like early airdrops (with Google Forms) and gradually grew up to writing smart contracts and securing the space.

- I'd spent 3 years studying computer networks at a technical college, which gave me a solid foundation for future growth and an unforgettable life experience (iykyk).
